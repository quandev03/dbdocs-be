/**
 * Infrastructure Persistence Entities
 * 
 * This package contains JPA entities and database-specific models
 * that represent the persistence layer implementation.
 * 
 * These entities are technical artifacts for data storage and
 * should be kept separate from domain models.
 * 
 * Principles:
 * - Framework-specific (JPA annotations)
 * - Focused on persistence concerns
 * - Separate from domain models
 * - Mapping to/from domain models
