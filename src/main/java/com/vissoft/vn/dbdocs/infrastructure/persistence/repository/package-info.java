/**
 * Infrastructure Persistence Repository Adapters
 * 
 * This package contains adapter implementations that bridge
 * between application ports and external persistence systems.
 * 
 * These adapters implement application ports and use framework-specific
 * technologies like Spring Data JPA to fulfill persistence contracts.
 * 
 * Examples: UserPersistenceAdapter implements UserPersistencePort
 * 
 * Principles:
 * - Implement application ports
 * - Use framework-specific technologies
 * - Handle data mapping and transformation
 * - Isolate persistence concerns
