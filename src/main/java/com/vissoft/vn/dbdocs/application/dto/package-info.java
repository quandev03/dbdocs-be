/**
 * Application Data Transfer Objects
 * 
 * This package contains DTOs used within the application layer
 * for transferring data between use cases and external layers.
 * 
 * These DTOs are application-specific and designed to support
 * use case requirements and data flow.
 * 
 * Principles:
 * - Application-focused design
 * - Support use case data needs
 * - Decouple domain from external layers
 * - Immutable when possible
