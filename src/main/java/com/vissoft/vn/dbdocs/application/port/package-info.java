/**
 * Application Ports - Hexagonal Architecture Interfaces
 * 
 * This package contains port interfaces that define contracts
 * between the application core and external adapters.
 * 
 * Ports represent the application's needs from external systems
 * and are implemented by adapters in the infrastructure layer.
 * 
 * Examples: UserPersistencePort, NotificationPort, EmailPort
 * 
 * Principles:
 * - Define what the application needs
 * - Abstract external dependencies
 * - Use case specific interfaces
 * - No implementation details
