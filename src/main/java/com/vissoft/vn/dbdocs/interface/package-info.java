/**
 * Interface Layer - External Interface Adapters
 * 
 * This package contains adapters that handle external communication
 * and translate between external formats and application use cases.
 * 
 * This is the entry point for external requests (HTTP, messaging, etc.)
 * and coordinates with application use cases to fulfill requests.
 * 
 * Principles:
 * - Handle external communication protocols
 * - Translate between external and internal formats
 * - Delegate business logic to use cases
 * - Framework-specific implementations
