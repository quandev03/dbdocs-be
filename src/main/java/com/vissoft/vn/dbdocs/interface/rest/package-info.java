/**
 * REST Interface Adapters
 * 
 * This package contains REST controllers that handle HTTP requests
 * and translate them to application use case calls.
 * 
 * Controllers act as adapters between HTTP protocol and application logic,
 * handling request/response mapping and validation.
 * 
 * Principles:
 * - Handle HTTP protocol concerns
 * - Validate input data
 * - Delegate to use cases
 * - Map responses to HTTP format
