/**
 * Domain Repository Interfaces
 * 
 * This package contains repository interfaces that define contracts
 * for data access operations in domain terms.
 * 
 * These are pure domain interfaces without any infrastructure concerns.
 * They define what the domain needs from persistence, not how it's implemented.
 * 
 * Principles:
 * - Domain-focused interface design
 * - No framework dependencies
 * - Express business needs, not technical implementation
 * - Follow Repository pattern
