/**
 * Domain Services
 * 
 * This package contains domain services that encapsulate business logic
 * that doesn't naturally belong to a single entity or value object.
 * 
 * Domain services contain pure business logic and complex domain operations
 * that involve multiple entities or external domain concepts.
 * 
 * Examples: Password policies, business rules, domain calculations
 * 
 * Principles:
 * - Pure business logic
 * - No framework dependencies
 * - Stateless operations
 * - Domain-focused
